In this system your top level entity is an actor, able to send and receive messages. The components on this actor are also actors, and they can do all the actions of an actor as well.

The stomach would send a message to the top level actor, requesting food when it was hungry. That top level actor would send the message to the other components and those would decide if they can do anything about that. The sight component sees a berry bush which would satisfy this hunger, so it sends out a message asking to get to that bush. The navigation component gets this from the top level actor and then moves us to the berry bush, which then the stomach component consumes (in a more detailed example we might have a component which can hit objects to cause the berries to fall and it might collect these.). This sounds pretty complex just for the simple behavior of wanting to go eat a berry, but what if we want to switch out the navigation component to one that acts like the actor is a bird and can fly where it wants to go. Well that's no problem because it just takes the same message and doesn't need to know what other components sent that message.

If you get messages about being hungry and thirsty, which do you do? I think how you approach this may be a per game design decision. If I'm working on an environmental simulation, I could use the processing at the top level agent to filter and decide which messages to pass on based on simple rules I define for that agent type. My bunny agents could pick thirst over hunger, and idle wander when they have no desires. I don't particularly like this because you are tied to knowing about what types of messages are in the components below you, but if you know that a bunny is made up of x,y,z components then that isn't an issue. You could attempt to use some type of statistical or machine learning approach, creating a \"brain\" which makes decisions after being trained in the simulated environment. This approach seems to add another massive level of difficulty and complexity on this system though, and won't lead to tuning of the environment easily. To balance these two ideas, some type of system which attempts to maximize value based on behaviors and their expected values on the known state of things allows you to explicitly define high level behaviors of actors, tune their expected values to produce types of game play but still allow them to have some agency (especially if randomness is added in instead of pure maximization of value) in how they choose to go about their lives. I can define the aggressive general who sees more value in attacking enemy encampments and chooses that behavior more often to tell his officers to attack. Or tie the expected values to different components representing skills on the actor, and have an actor with a high mining skill expect more value from his mining returns and will therefore lean towards mining and selling his ore."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,"I'm not completely sold by any of my ideas for the \"brain\" of the actor or how to produce less primitive actors past the \"I'm hungry example\", but I do feel like the system has real flexibility and power.
