Despite being salaried and having my hours uncounted and uncared about, with us working on the just get your work done mentality, I tried to limit myself to 40 hours a week (although most weeks were hitting 50) to achieve some balance. I initially felt like this was enough and would give me balance. Even when projects would bog me down and I wouldn't want to do anything after work or would be consumed in thought even though I was off my clock, I didn't really consider that into my work life balance. A result of projects draining my mental at work was that I hadn't worked on any of my personal projects for a couple months.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Over vacation I was able to let go of everything at work and get back that mental fortitude I was missing. Just a couple days in I was wanting to work on personal projects again, but once I was home to work on them I got pretty demotivated. Once I was home, I realized that I didn't want to start a project because I was worried about returning to work and losing the motivation once I was bogged down again. I needed to think of work life balance as more than just the time I was actually working, but needed to include the actual mental state that work was leaving me in and finding a way to detach further and recover at the end of each day. For me it is really difficult to not get emotionally attached because I do care about all the work I'm doing and delivering quality, so when my code isn't done I just want to push it further naturally.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I hope I can improve over time, talk with others how they manage more than just the time at work and share more thoughts like these with others in their first job.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","frontmatter":{"title":"Recent Thoughts on Work Life Balance","author":"Bryson McIver","date":"July 14th, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c9318b53-f380-5ce2-a0e2-3ee2a889fb5c"}}}
