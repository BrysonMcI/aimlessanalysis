I love pushing myself to be the better than my previous self and solving\r\n        whatever difficult problems I can find. I've been playing games my whole life, and have participated in esports since college.\r\n        Many of the blog posts here are from trying to think through random problems or new ways to approach something.\r\n        I'm always looking for new opportunities and places where I can solve problems and if you think you have something like\r\n        that let's chat.
