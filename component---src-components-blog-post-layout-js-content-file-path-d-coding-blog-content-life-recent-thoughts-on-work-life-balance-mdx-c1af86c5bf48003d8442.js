Despite being salaried and having my hours uncounted and uncared about, with us working on the just get your work done mentality, I tried to limit myself to 40 hours a week (although most weeks were hitting 50) to achieve some balance. I initially felt like this was enough and would give me balance. Even when projects would bog me down and I wouldn't want to do anything after work or would be consumed in thought even though I was off my clock, I didn't really consider that into my work life balance.

Just a couple days in I was wanting to work on personal projects again, but once I was home to work on them I got pretty demotivated. Once I was home, I realized that I didn't want to start a project because I was worried about returning to work and losing the motivation once I was bogged down again. I needed to think of work life balance as more than just the time I was actually working, but needed to include the actual mental state that work was leaving me in and finding a way to detach further and recover at the end of each day.
